The origiona [smallpt.cpp](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)  written by  Kevin Beason is a 99 line ray tracer writen in C++.  As a minimmal ray tracer it is often ported to different languages. This is a cleanup and optimization of [the Haskell port done by noteed (Vo Minh Thu) ](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallpt-hs).

This repository serves an education purpose; the commit history depicts the sequence of optimizations one might perform on the initial source code to arrive at a version that is performance-comparable with C++.

This repository was used for a talk at [Haskell Exchange 2020](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/13135-haskell-exchange-2020). [Slides](https://github.com/bollu/slides-haskell-exchange-2020-smallpt) based on the commits in this repo are available.
